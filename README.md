# Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Sign Language Detection** system using the **Random Forest algorithm**. It processes hand gestures captured via a webcam and identifies corresponding sign language gestures. The system leverages Python and several key libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and perform predictions.

## Features
- Real-time sign language detection.
- Utilizes the **Random Forest algorithm** for classification.
- Efficient gesture recognition using the **MediaPipe** library for hand tracking.
- Stores the trained model using **Pickle** for future use.
- Highly customizable and extendable.

## Technologies and Libraries
The project is built in Python and utilizes the following libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image and video capture and processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand landmark detection and gesture tracking.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For implementing the Random Forest algorithm and model evaluation.
- **os**: For handling file and directory operations.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Captures hand landmarks and gesture data using **MediaPipe**.
   - Stores the collected data as features for training.

2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Features such as hand positions and angles are extracted using **NumPy**.
   - Labels for each gesture are assigned.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - The **Random Forest algorithm** from scikit-learn is trained on the preprocessed features.
   - The trained model is saved using **Pickle** for later use.

4. **Real-Time Prediction**:
   - Captures video frames using **OpenCV**.
   - Uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand gestures in real-time.
   - Predicts the corresponding sign language gesture using the trained Random Forest model.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include more gestures.
- Improve detection accuracy by exploring other machine learning algorithms.
- Add support for multiple sign languages.
- Deploy the system as a web or mobile application.
